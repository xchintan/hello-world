# hello-world
Current Level: A cave programmer

"When the first caveman programmer chiseled the first program on the walls of the first cave computer, it was
a program to paint the string `Hello, world' in Antelope pictures. Also Roman programming textbooks began with
the `Salut, Mundi' program. I don't know what happens to people who break with this tradition, but I think it's
safer not to find out. We'll start with a series of hello world programs that demonstrate the different aspects of
the basics of writing a kernel module."

So keeping the tradition alive, here is my first repo, hello-world.
